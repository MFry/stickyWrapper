This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Technical Details

Using [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) and [query selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) against the data attributes we can create highly customizable sticky wrappers.
